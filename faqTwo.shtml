				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>If I do not sign the pledge or word it correctly on an 
					assignment, am I safe from an Honor System violation?</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>No, all assignments must be pledged. If the pledge is 
						not present, either the professor or the Honor Board will 
						give you the opportunity to sign it. A refusal to do this 
						is treated as an admission of guilt.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>Is it acceptable to use a stamp of the pledge in lieu of 
					writing it out?</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Using a prewritten stamp or electronic text is considered 
						to be an adequate substitute for physically writing out 
						the Honor Pledge as long as there is a valid signature.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>Is it necessary to "sign" a document if it is submitted online?</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>All assignments must be pledged, therefore electronic signatures 
						or some other variation (i.e. typing out the pledge and typing your name) is required.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>Should tutors or classmates be listed as references on homework 
					and assignments?</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Yes. When the professor allows collaboration, even working 
						with classmates counts as aid and must be referenced on 
						the assignment.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>My professor claims I was cheating and decided to fail me. 
					What should I do?</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Immediately report the case to the Honor Board. Every 
						student has the right to have his/her accused violations 
						be investigated by the Honor Board. The only case where 
						the professor can ever investigate violations is a faculty 
						adjudication (see below).</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>What is a &#8220;faculty adjudication&#8221;? What is the 13% rule?</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>If the professor or TA suspects you committed an 
						Honor System violation on an assignment that is worth less than 
						13% of your grade, then the professor can approach you about 
						his or her suspicions and render a penalty for the violation from 
						within our Penalty Matrix, rather than submitting it to 
						the Honor Board for a formal investigation.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>My professor approached me regarding a faculty adjudication, 
					but I didn't commit an Honor System violation or the penalty is way too high. Can the Honor 
					Board investigate? </h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Yes. As long as you did not sign agreeing to the penalty, 
						you can report your case to the Honor Board, at which point 
						it is out of the professor&#8217;s hands.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>I think I saw my classmate cheating during an exam, but 
					I&#8217;m not sure. Should I report it, and if so, how? </h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Yes, even if you&#8217;re not sure, it&#8217;s your responsibility 
						to report anything you see. The Honor Board will investigate 
						further and determine if there is evidence of a violation. 
						You can report all violations on the Honor System website 
						by clicking &#8220;Report a Violation&#8221;.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>I am being investigated for an Honor System violation. Am 
					I allowed to consult with my friend who is on the Honor Board.</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Any case details must be restricted to conversation 
						with the investigative committee assigned to the case. However, 
						a DA will be assigned to your case to answer any questions 
						you may have about how the Honor System operates. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>What&#8217;s the difference between &#8220;unauthorized aid&#8221;, &#8220;plagiarism&#8221;, 
					&#8220;lack of referencing&#8221;, &#8220;copying answers&#8221;, and &#8220;prohibited collaboration&#8221;?
					</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>A proper assignment or exam is one where only authorized 
						aid was used and all aid was used properly and cited/referenced. 
						Unauthorized aid is when you use aid that was specifically 
						not allowed by the professor or TA. Plagiarism is when you 
						are using authorized aid improperly by copying directly 
						and trying to pass it off as your own work. Lack of referencing 
						is when you use authorized aid properly but forget to cite 
						it on your assignment. As for copying answers and prohibited 
						collaboration, they are the same as plagiarism and unauthorized 
						aid, respectively, and are just different terms used for 
						homework assignments and exams. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>As an undergraduate student, am I protected by the Honor 
					System in my graduate courses?</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>No, any graduate course taken is subject to the policy on 
						academic improprieties contained in the Graduate Handbook.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>What is a removable academic sanction, and how can it be 
					removed? </h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>An academic sanction is a transcript mark indicating 
						that you performed an Honor System violation. If the Honor 
						Board decides to assign a removable academic sanction, you 
						can remove the transcript mark by completing either an essay(s) 
						or the ethics course over a certain period of time. If you 
						successfully complete the essay(s) or ethics course in the 
						allotted period of time, the mark will be automatically 
						removed. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>Once an academic sanction is removed, is there any trace 
					that I had it?</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>No, but there is still a record of you committing an 
						Honor System violation. If another institution or company 
						contacts Stevens and requests if there are any reports in 
						your file, the fact that you committed an Honor System violation 
						will be disclosed regardless of whether or not you have 
						an Academic Sanction.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>What is the Ethics Course? </h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>The Ethics Course is an Honor Board-created independent 
						study course that allows students to remove academic sanctions 
						by completing a variety of tasks. The tasks range from writing 
						essays to reading books to attending ASC seminars. See the 
						Ethics Course manual for more information. You may only 
						use the Ethics Course to remove an academic sanction if 
						the Honor Board allows you to do so. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>Can I appeal my Honor Board investigation after I confessed/was 
					found guilty? </h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Yes. No matter how the investigation ends, you may appeal 
						your case to the Academic Appeals committee if you believe: 
						a) the Honor Board did not properly follow procedure; or 
						b) the penalty assigned is too harsh. Additionally, you 
						may even appeal the decision of the Academic Appeals committee 
						to the Provost, who has the final say. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>What are some examples of penalties the Honor Board assigns?
					</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Honor Board penalties usually fall into three categories: 
						grade changes, academic sanctions, and suspensions/expulsions. 
						Grade changes can range from partial credit on the affected 
						assignment to a failure in the course. See above for what 
						an academic sanction is. For long-term consistency, the 
						Honor Board references the Penalty Matrix available on the 
						website whenever voting upon a penalty. The Honor Board 
						usually assigns penalties within the ranges listed in the 
						matrix. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				

			


				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>Are there any benefits to confessing if I know I cheated?
					</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Yes. When the Honor Board votes, they take both mitigating 
						and aggravating factors into consideration. Mitigating factors 
						include but are not limited to prompt responses to Honor 
						Board communications, cooperation throughout the investigation, 
						immediate admission of guilt, and apologizing for the violation 
						that occurred. Aggravating factors include but are not limited 
						to intentionally delaying the investigation and being uncooperative 
						throughout the investigation.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>Should I confess if I am innocent? </h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>No. Even though confessing is sometimes a quick way 
						out, you should only ever confess to an Honor System violation 
						if you actually committed the violation. This student run 
						system is in place to protect your rights. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>How long do I have to report a violation?</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Students can report an Honor System Violation as long as it is within ten days
						 of the suspected violation occurence. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>

			<h2>Faculty</h2>
			<div data-role="collapsible-set" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="c">
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>If I caught a student obviously cheating on an exam, does 
					it have to be reported to the Honor Board? What if they are 
					already failing the class? </h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Yes. All violations must be reported to the Honor Board, 
						no matter how obvious and regardless of the student&#8217;s current 
						or projected grade in the class. The only exception is faculty 
						adjudication (see below), and even then the result of the 
						adjudication must be submitted to the Honor Board. The reason 
						being that a record needs to be kept of all violations to 
						be sure that recurring violations are treated with the proper 
						magnitude.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>If a student confesses to me about cheating on an exam, 
					why can I not simply give them a zero?</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Stevens believes in a fair system such that a student 
						caught cheating not only has the right to an investigation 
						and hearing, but also that he/she will receive a similar 
						penalty as other students who committed the the same violation 
						in the past. Because of this, all violations must be investigated 
						and penalized through the Honor Board, regardless of the 
						circumstances. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>When can I submit a suspected violation as a Faculty Adjudication?
					</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Faculty Adjudications are reserved only for small assignments, 
						defined as anything worth 13 percent or less of the final 
						grade in the course. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>How do I perform a faculty adjudication?</h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Download the faculty adjudication form from the Honor 
						Board&#8217;s website and fill it out. Make sure to add the student&#8217;s 
						name, the violation, and the penalty. The penalty *must* 
						be within the guidelines set by the Honor Board&#8217;s penalty 
						matrix. Then meet with the student and ask them about the 
						suspected violation. If they sign the faculty adjudication 
						form admitting to the violation and agreeing to the penalty, 
						you can then send it in to the Honor Board through e-mail 
						to honor@stevens.edu or hand it in to one of our advisors, 
						Dean Berkley on the 10th floor of Howe or Kurtis Watkins 
						on the 7th floor of Howe.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>What happens if a student does not sign my faculty adjudication 
					form? </h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>If a student refuses to sign, either because they deny 
						the violation or they think the penalty is too harsh, you 
						should report the violation to the Honor Board as if it 
						was a traditional violation, i.e., not a faculty adjudication. 
						The Honor Board will perform a thorough investigation and 
						assign a penalty if the student confesses or is convicted.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>Where should I be during an exam? </h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Since the Honor System does not allow proctoring, you 
						cannot be actively observing the exam. There are some cases 
						where it is allowable to be in the exam room, but the best 
						option is to just wait in a nearby office or other room 
						for the duration of the exam. Make sure students know where 
						you will be and remain available for any students who were 
						given valid extensions for the exam&#8217;s ending time. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>It has come to my attention that some students in the class 
					have a substantial collection of previous year&#8217;s tests. What 
					do you recommend? </h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Regardless of any efforts to prevent students from passing 
						along old exams to their subsequent classmates, it is inevitable 
						that some will surface. Therefore, the Honor Board recommends 
						making these exams available to all students. By doing this, 
						it levels the playing field for the entire class. The Honor 
						Board also strongly advocates professors not using the same 
						test multiple times. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div data-role="collapsible">
					<h2>How long do I have to report a violation? </h2>
					<ul data-role="listview">
						<li>Professors are allowed to report an Honor System Violation within ten days of grading the assignment on which the suspected violation occurred. </li>

<h1 class="style5">Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h1>
<h2 class="style3">Character of a Stevens Student</h2>
<p>Stevens students live out the core values of the Honor System each and every day:</p>
<p class="style12">Honest: Always tell the truth</p>
<p class="style12">Trustworthy: Speak and act genuinely</p>
<p class="style12">Fair: Never take any shortcuts to get ahead of other people, holding yourself as an equal to everyone else</p>
<p class="style12">Respectful: Honor yourself, your peers, your professors and Stevens by always doing the right thing</p>
  <p class="style12">Responsible: Conduct yourself as a professional in your academics, turn in assignments on time, keep organized, communicate with your professor</p>
  <p class="style12">Courageous: Have the voice to speak up when something is wrong</p>
  
  
  
  
    <h2 class="style3">Tips to Upholding Your Integrity: Study Habits/Time Management</h2>
  <p>Cheating does not have to be the answer! There are many ways to prepare so that you do not feel like you are forced into a situation where your academic reputation can be hindered.</p>
  <p class="style12">1. Ask for help! Entering college is difficult, but that doesn&#39;t mean you should stop asking questions! If you feel like you are struggling in a course, ask for help from a TA, a professor, or even apply for a tutor. There are many avenues to explore when it comes to finding academic assistance. Asking for help isn&#39;t a sign of weakness; it is encouraged so you don&#39;t feel like you have to resort to unethical behaviors during tests, quizzes or projects. If you are unsure of how to study for a particular course, ask a tutor or a student who has already gone through the course so they can give you advice.</p>
  <p class="style12">2. Use your resources. The school offers resources to all students across all different majors.  The Academic Support Center Walk-In Tutoring Center and the Writing and Communications Center are great places to start.</p>
  <p class="style12">3. Use effective time management. It is important for college students to use their time wisely. This does not mean that one has to sacrifice every weekend to study for exams that are months away; however, it is important to schedule time to study, complete homework, and complete projects. Using tools such as Google/iCalendar or planners will keep you on track, and this will help you allot time for both academics and extracurricular activities.</p>
  <p class="style12">4. Set realistic goals. You may feel overwhelmed as a new college student. However, you must set realistic expectations as you proceed in your studies. You do not need to get perfect 100s on your exams and quizzes to graduate college. You need to put forth your best effort, and the success will follow. You cannot be too hard on yourself, especially as freshman. Concentrate on your studies, but getting a 4.0 is not the most important thing.</p>
  <p class="style12">5. Study with others. Stevens focuses a lot on group work, so it would be to your best advantage to study with others. If you isolate yourself, it may be harder to overcome difficult subjects if you are struggling. If you study in groups, you&#39;ll have both the opportunity to teach other students who are struggling and hear other methods and techniques to solving difficult problems.</p>

    <h2 class="style3">You and the Stevens Honor System</h2>
    <p>Your Roles: Enrollment into the undergraduate class of Stevens Institute of Technology signifies a student's commitment to the Honor System. It is the responsibility of each student to become acquainted with and to uphold the ideals set forth in the Honor System Constitution. Specific student responsibilities include:</p>
<p class="style12">Maintaining honesty and fair play in all aspects of academic life at Stevens.</p>
<p class="style12">Writing and signing the pledge, in full, on all submitted academic work.</p>
<p class="style12">Hold yourself and others accountable by reporting any suspected honor system violations</p>
<p class="style12">Cooperating with the Honor Board during investigations and hearings.</p>
<!--<p>What is an Honor System violation? A violation is any action that does not conform to the spirit of the Stevens Honor System.  Any situation in which a student has an unfair advantage over a classmate(s) constitutes a violation. Failure in clearly citing all the references, if any, used in an assignment infringes upon the rights of others, and constitutes a violation. In instances where external sources are utilized, they must be identified and due credit given using an appropriate bibliography format.</p>-->
    <h2 class="style3">The Honor System Pledge:</h2>
    <p>The pledge signifies that the work submitted by a student is indeed his/her own. There is one designated pledge to be used for tests, homework assignments, lab reports, and computer projects. The pledge shall be written in full and signed by the student on all submitted academic work. Any references used (including texts, tutors, classmates, etc.) should be listed below the written pledge.</p>
<p class="style7"><strong>"I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System."</strong></p>
  <h2 class="style3">Reporting a Potential Violation:</h2>
  <p>Each Stevens student plays a key role in upholding the community of honor and trust that we have at Stevens.  The Honor System protects the value of a Stevens degree by giving employers peace of mind that Stevens students are the most qualified and well educated candidates.  If you witness someone violating the Stevens Honor System, it is your responsibility to report the suspected violation.  Professors/TA/faculty members can also report violations.  Everyone at Stevens has to hold each other accountable.  The value of each Stevens degree is upheld by the Honor System and the belief that each student earns his or her degree with honesty and integrity.</p>
  <a href="violationreport.shtml">Submit a Violation</a><br/><br/>
    <h2 class="style3">Faculty Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>As a member of the Stevens community, it is the responsibility of each faculty member to understand and abide by the Honor System. It is not the role of the faculty member to resolve suspected violations, but to report these alleged infractions to an Honor Board member or to the Dean of Student Development. A paramount responsibility of the faculty is to ensure that the pledge is fully written and signed on all collected academic work.</p>
<span class="style10">
<p>Additional faculty responsibilities include:</p>
<p class="style12">Appearing before investigating committees and hearings, as well as
        participating in other functions, when requested to do so by the
        Honor Board.</p>
<p class="style12">Educating new faculty and teaching assistants regarding the
        principles and operations of the Honor System.</p>
    <!--<ul>
      <li>Appearing before investigating committees and hearings, as well as
        participating in other functions, when requested to do so by the
        Honor Board.</li>
		<li>Educating new faculty and teaching assistants regarding the
        principles and operations of the Honor System.</span></li>
    </ul>-->
    <h2 class="style3">Violations</h2>
    <p>A violation is any action that does not conform to the spirit of the Stevens Honor System. Any situation in which a student has an unfair advantage over their classmates constitutes a violation.
      Failure in clearly citing all the references, if any, used in an assignment infringes upon the rights of others, and constitutes a violation. In instances where external sources are utilized, they must be identified and due credit given using an appropriate bibliography format.
      Tolerance is a violation of the Honor System; a student who is aware that the academic integrity of the Institute is being compromised and neglects to report this is guilty of an Honor System infraction.</p>
    <h2 class="style3">Honor Board Investigating Committees</h2>
    <p>Upon written notification of an alleged infraction, the chair of the Honor Board will appoint an Investigating Committee (IC) consisting of two or more members of the Board. It is the role of the IC to conduct a thorough investigation into the violation by interviewing all persons connected with the case and reviewing any physical evidence. Information obtained during the investigation will be kept confidential and discreet by those parties involved with the case and by the Honor Board. The student accused of the violation will be notified of the pending investigation by the IC and be given the opportunity to present his/her explanation of what transpired to the committee. The accused may choose to sign a written confession at this time. If there is no confession, the accused party will be notified the result of the investigation. If there is insufficient evidence to support a violation, the case will be dropped. However, if there is sufficient evidence to question the academic integrity of the individual accused, then a Hearing date is scheduled.</p>
    <h2 class="style3">Hearings</h2>
    <p>Hearings may be open or closed depending on the
	wishes of the accused. An open hearing is restricted to members of the
	Stevens Community. The hearing begins with a statement of charge by the
	Honor Board and a response to this charge by the accused. The Honor Board
	introduces the case and proceeds by presenting evidence and calling
	witnesses. After the Honor Board presents the results of its investigation,
	the accused will have the chance to present any relevant evidence and call
	witnesses on his/her behalf. Both the Honor Board and the accused party will
	have the opportunity to question all witnesses.</p>
<p>During a hearing, the Chair of the Honor Board will mediate the proceedings and deem what evidence and questioning is pertinent to the case. After carefully reviewing both sides of the case, a six member jury, comprised of the student's peers, will reach a unanimous decision of guilty or not guilty. If the outcome is "not guilty," then all charges are dropped. However, if the jury renders a "guilty" verdict, then the Honor Board prescribes a penalty that must be approved by the Dean of Student Development.</p>
<p class="style2"><strong>
<a href="documents/Penalty%20Matrix.pdf">View the
Penalty Matrix</a></strong></p>
    <h2 class="style3">Appeals</h2>
    <p>Submit a letter to Dean Rosemary Dice in the Office of Undergraduate Academics with the reasons for the appeal within fourteen (14) days of the hearing. The Dean of Undergraduate Academics will review the appeal and based on the appeal criteria, decide if an appeal is granted.  If granted the Dean will give the appeal to the Academic Appeals committee.</p>
    <h2 class="style3">Responsibilities of the Honor Board</h2>
    <p>The Honor Board is responsible for presenting the philosophy and functions of the Honor System to the student body and faculty in a language that is readable and understandable. It is the duty of the Honor Board to interpret the constitution of the Honor System and to define violations of the Honor System.
      All investigations and hearings of the board must be executed in a quick and fair fashion. When a breach of the system has been committed, the Board recommends a penalty that may range from zero credit to be given on the questioned work to a maximum penalty of expulsion from the Institute.
      Honor Board members are eligible to vote on all decisions of the Board. It is the role of these members to serve on Investigating
	Committees when appointed by the chair. The officers include the chair, vice chair, corresponding secretary, and recording secretary.</p>
    <h2 class="style3">Additional Notes</h2>
    <p class="style10">The Stevens Honor System is a dynamic system that facilitates the changing needs of both students and faculty. Its success is dependent upon the support of the entire Stevens community.
      The Honor System is a privilege of the students during their undergraduate years at Stevens. Students are encouraged to address any questions regarding the workings of the Honor System to an Honor Board member. The Honor System has been designed to protect
	<strong>you</strong>, the student. Preserving its strength and integrity is
	<strong>your</strong> responsibility.</p>
