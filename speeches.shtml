"Throughout my educational career and my personal life, I have adhered to a set of core moral standards. Among the most important of my values are respect for others, honesty towards myself and those around me, and above all, doing everything in a fair manner. I am running for Honor Board because I am fiercely proud that I have gotten to where I stand now by sticking to these guiding principles. Not only do I hold the Stevens Core Values-honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility-to heart, but I am also a confident speaker who can help others understand how the Honor System protects these key tenets. Moreover, I am good at listening actively to people both individually and during a proceeding. Finally, with respect to investigations, I have the ability to isolate the facts of a case and render an objective judgment. Going forward, I want to set a conspicuous example of academic integrity and personal character by serving on the Honor Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I think that I can bring a very fair and unbiased opinion.  I would very much like to expand and extend the average student's knowledge and understanding of the Honor System.  It is important for every student to know the school's rules and guidelines when it comes to academics."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"I would like to be a part of the Honor Board because I feel that Stevens' honor and integrity is something that makes this school special and a great place to be a part of.  I also feel that it's important that everyone gets a fair trial and isn't wrongly persecuted for something they are being accused of.  I can contribute a fresh, fair, and understanding voice to the Board.  I believe in keeping everything fair and hearing all sides of a situation and making sure the appropriate decision and actions are made."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
