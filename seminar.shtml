<p>This Ethics Course is designed for students convicted of an Honor System Violation. 
It is a learning experience which will provide the students with a chance for 
reflection and growth. The course consists of mandatory and elective tasks, and an 
Honor Board representative will be assigned to help guide the student through the 
process. The student is expected to regularly interface with his assigned Honor Board 
mentor throughout the progression of the course. The Honor Board mentor shall also be 
responsible for ensuring that the student's progress on the course is satisfactory and 
all materials submitted for the course are subject to approval by the mentor and Honor 
Board executive board.</p>

	<li>&nbsp;The students will
	choose their own plan for self-improvement and reflect on their past
	actions.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The students will gain a deeper understanding of the concept of
	ethics and how ethical behavior should and can be incorporated into both
	professional and academic life.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The students will gain a deeper understanding and respect for the
	Stevens Honor System and learn how to support and uphold it.</li>

<p>When the student is assigned the Ethics Course, he will also be assigned 
an Honor Board Mentor.  The student will be notified of his mentor's name and 
contact information at thetime of the penalty notification. IT IS STRONGLY 
RECOMMENDED THAT THE STUDENT CONTACT THE BOARD WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF RECEIVING 
THE OFFICIAL PENALTY NOTIFICATION FROM THE BOARD. The student must meet with 
the Mentor to create a proposal detailing his plans for completion of the course; 
the proposal will include the elective components the student has chosen. The 
Mentor will serve as an Advisor, answer the student's questions, and clarify any 
uncertainties. THE PROPOSAL MUST BE SUBMITTED AND APPROVED BY A MEMBER OF THE 
HONOR BOARD EXECUTIVE BOARD BEFORE THE STUDENT CAN COMMENCE THE REMAINDER OF THE COURSE.
</p>
<p>The Ethics Course consists  of  two components which are described in detail in the 
following sections. The components are:</p>
<p>1. Elective Tasks **</p>
<p>2. A Reflection Paper following the completion of all Elective Tasks</p>
<p>**Each Elective Task is weighted in accordance with its difficulty and 
opportunities for growth. The student's proposal must include at least 15 
points worth of elective tasks. The student must choose from the following 
list of elective tasks, but has the option to generate a self-initiated task 
subject to approval by the Honor Board Mentor.</p>

Ethics Course until the proposal has been submitted and approved.</p>

<p>After the student has completed writing his proposal, he must sign it and give it 
to his Honor Board Mentor. The proposal is subject to approval by the Honor Board 
Mentor and Advisor.</p>
<p>If a member of the Honor Board executive board approves the proposal, the student 
will be notified and may begin completing his tasks. If a student's proposal is not

The Reflection Paper must be 3-5 pages long and must address:</p>
<p>1. The factors that led to having to complete the Ethics Course </p>
<p>2. Each task that was completed and how it contributed to the student&#8217;s
learning process. The student may choose to discuss which tasks were his favorite

<p>3. What was learned and gained from taking the course and whether the
personal goals set in the proposal were met. Specific goals stated in the proposal

<p>Throughout the Ethics Course, the student may choose to keep an Ethics Journal. 
The purpose of the Ethics Journal is to track the student's progress in the course, 
provide an opportunity to reflect on each of the completed tasks, and provide an 
overall reflection of the learning experience. It is recommended that the student 
write in it at least once per week throughout the course. The journal may be in any 
format, but must be typed. There are two types of entries that the journal may include.</p>
<p>The first type are entries corresponding to each <strong>
<span class="style7">elective</span></strong> task completed during the <br />
course. These entries must address the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What task was completed? What was done to complete it? </p>
<p>2. What was learned from this task? Was it a good learning experience? How
did it help the student grow as a person? </p>
<p>3. What is the student&#8217;s feedback about this task? (The student may choose to
write negative things about the tasks in this journal. This is the Honor Board&#8217;s
chance to get criticism or advice from the student about the course!) </p>
<p>The second type of entry must provide further reflection or comments on an ethical 
dilemma or difficult decision faced in the student&#8217;s personal or professional life. Some 
questions that may be addressed are:</p>
<p>1. What was the situation? Was it a hard decision to make?</p>
<p>2. What were the pros and cons of each option?</p>
<p>3. What option was chosen and why?</p>
<p>4. What was the impact of this decision?</p>
<p>To earn 2 points, the student must have entries of the first type for each elective 
task. Five additional entries of the second type will earn the student 1 more point. 
The maximum total amount of points that may be earned with the Ethics Journal is 3 
points towards the completion of the course.</p>

<p>The student may retake the assignment on which his Honor System violation occurred 
ONLY IF THE STUDENT IS NOT CURRENTLY OR EVER PLANNING TO RETAKE THE COURSE IN WHICH 
THE VIOLATION OCCURRED. Retaking the assignment will NOT count for credit in the 
class. The student is expected to put his full effort into this assignment, as if it 
were to be graded. After completing the assignment, it is highly recommended that the 
student submit it to the professor as a way to show that he is serious about learning 
the material with integrity and honor. If the assignment is a quiz or homework 
assignment, the student will earn 1 point; if it is a test, exam, or paper, he will 
earn 2 points.

<p>The student may choose to attend up to two seminars offered by the Academic Support 
Center. A list of the workshops being offered by the Academic Support Center can be 
found at www.stevens.edu/asc. Some of these workshops may require pre-registration, 
so the student must pay attention to all the details when viewing the available 
options. There may be other seminars offered throughout the campus, but not through 
the Academic Support Center. These seminars also may be acceptable if they relate to 
the personal improvement goals outlined in the student's proposal, and if they are 
approved by his Honor Board Mentor. The student must state in his proposal which 
seminars he plans to attend and how they will contribute to his personal growth. Note 
that since the Ethics Course must be completed within 6 months from the date of the 
official penalty notification, the seminar that the student attends must also be 
during that time frame.</p>
<p>When the student attends the seminar, he will need to complete the form located in 
Appendix C and have the presenter of the seminar sign to confirm his attendance. Each 
seminar that the student attends will be worth 1 point towards completion of the

a speech on the Honor System to a group of his peers. It must be delivered to at least 
10 other students who may be members of a club, sports team, Greek house, class, or 
any other group selected by the student. The speech must be at least 15 minutes long 
and may utilize any appropriate audio/ visual aid. The student must state in the 
proposal who will be the audience for the speech and why he chose that group of 
students. The student may choose to use some of the following talking points in his 
speech or come up with his own:</p>
<ul class="style4">

</ul>
<p>The student will earn 2 points if his presentation discusses the above topics. 
However, the student can earn an additional point (for a total of 3 points) if they 
also discuss their personal experience with the Honor System and what they have taken 
away from that experience.</p>
<p>Information regarding the Honor System may be found on the Honor Board website or 
the mentor can provide the student with additional information as needed.</p>
<p>A draft of the student's presentation must be approved by the Honor Board Mentor 
prior to its delivery. Also, the student must alert the Honor Board Mentor of the 
time and place for the speech. It is required that at least one Honor Board 
Representative be present when the speech is made. If no Honor Board members are able 
to attend, the audience members must complete the official signature form at the

<p>Passing the Ethics Course is always subject to approval by the Honor Board mentor and 
Honor Board Advisor.  This is reflected in the final evaluation form to be completed at the 
exit interview.  If at any time during the course, the Honor Board mentor or Honor Board 
Advisor deems that submission(s) from the student are unsatisfactory, they may refuse 
to accept the submission(s) and request either that the student redoes or revises the task or 
abandons that task and completes another task to fulfill their point requirement. Passing 
the Ethics Course is always subject to approval by the Honor Board mentor and Honor Board 
executive board. This is reflected in the final evaluation form to be completed at the exit 
interview. If at any time during the course, the Honor Board mentor or Honor Board executive 
board deems that submission(s) from the student are unsatisfactory, they may refuse to 
accept the submission(s) and request either that the student redoes or revises the task or 
abandons that task and completes another task to fulfill their point requirement.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the student should complete this Ethics Course while 
adhering to the principals set forth in the Constitution and Bylaws of the Stevens 
Honor System. If a student is suspected of violating the Honor System while completing 
the course, their progress will be suspended while the Honor Board investigates the 
issue. The mentor will first confront the student about the issue and present the 
issue to the Honor Board. Based on that, the Honor Board may by a majority vote open 
an investigation or settle the problem by another method. If the student is found 
guilty or confesses to violating the Honor System during the ethics course, a penalty 
shall be rendered by the Honor Board in the procedure outlined in the Constitution and 
Bylaws. Note that penalties rendered by the Honor Board could range anywhere from 
redoing a task for the Ethics Course to expulsion from the institute, depending on the 
severity of the violation.</p>
<p>If the Honor Board executive board discovers that the student has committed any 
unethical act or code of conduct violation during the six month period of the Ethics 
Course, they have the discretion, upon a majority vote, to stop the student's progress 
on the course resulting in a failure of the Ethics Course.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all Ethics Course materials MUST be submitted within 6 months of the 
date of the penalty notification. Also, the Exit Interview with the Honor Board mentor 
MUST conducted before the 6 month deadline. The student will not be allowed to submit 
materials after this deadline. Any extensions are subject to approval by a majority 
vote of the Honor Board executive board, and must be requested at least one week 
before the deadline. Failing to complete the Ethics Course before the deadline 
constitute grounds for failure on the Ethics Course.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of both the student and the Honor Board Mentor to stay in 
regular contact with each other to ensure the student's smooth progression in the 
course. Following the completion of each task, the student is required to submit all 
required materials to his Honor Board Mentor. The Honor Board Mentor shall be 
responsible for maintaining a folder of all material submitted. Once the student has 
completed and submitted paperwork for all mandatory and elective tasks in his 
proposal, he will sit down with his Honor Board Mentor for a final exit interview, at 
which time the Final Evaluation Form must be completed. This form is available in 
Appendix G. During the final exit interview, the student and Mentor will discuss the 
student's accomplishments and evaluate his overall learning experience.</p>
<p>The Final Evaluation Form and all other materials will be submitted to the Honor 
Board executive board for approval. A member of the Honor Board executive board will 
determine if the student has satisfactorily completed the Ethics Course. After reviewing 
the material the executive board may choose to meet with the student, or ask the student 
to redo or revise certain components of the course. When a member of the Honor Board 
executive board approves the student's work and signs the Final Evaluation Form, the 
student is considered to have completed the Ethics Course.</p>
